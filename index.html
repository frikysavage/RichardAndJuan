              <strong>25 years ago: </strong>
              Drug lord Pablo Escobar was killed 25 years ago, ending the life of one of the world’s most notorious outlaws,
              responsible for an unprecedented number of deaths and a bomb attack in Colombia.

              <strong>Some good: </strong>
            But overcoming Escobar’s legacy is not easy and in his hometown of Medellin, residents who live in homes he built for
            them are planning heartfelt tributes to mark Sunday’s anniversary.

              <strong>Testimony: </strong>
              “He was a good person who also had to do bad things, otherwise he would have been killed earlier. He helped many,”
              Emanuel Lara Rodriguez, a Mexican tourist in Colombia told Al Jazeera.

              <strong>How he died</strong>
              Escobar was killed in a rooftop shoot-out with police and army soldiers in Medellin on December 2, 1993, one day after
              his 44th birthday and five months after he appeared on Forbes magazine’s list of the world’s richest people for the
              seventh time.
